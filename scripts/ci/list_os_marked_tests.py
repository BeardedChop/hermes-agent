"""List the test files that carry a given platform marker.

Used by the marked-OS lane of ``.github/workflows/tests.yml`` to scope what
the macOS lane imports.

Why scope at all, when ``pytest -m macos_only`` already selects correctly?
Because ``-m`` filters AFTER collection, and collection IMPORTS every test
module under ``tests/``. On the Linux lane that is fine (it runs them all
anyway), but on the macOS/Windows lanes it would drag ~900 unrelated modules
through import on a host they were never expected to import on — one
unrelated ImportError would fail a job whose actual subject passed. Narrowing
the paths keeps each lane's failure signal about its own tests.

``-m`` is still passed by the workflow and remains the authoritative
selector: this script only decides which files get imported, never which
tests run. Over-selecting here is harmless (``-m`` drops the extras); the
failure mode to care about is UNDER-selecting, which is why the workflow
fails the job when zero tests end up selected.

Markers accepted:

  * the composable ``platforms`` form (e.g. ``@pytest.mark.platforms("macos")``
    or ``pytest.mark.platforms("macos", ...)``). The script matches any
    ``platforms(...)`` usage that names the platform in question — including
    negated specs (``"not macos"`` lists the file for the macOS lane: the
    lane's ``-m`` filter then decides what actually runs). Whole-word
    matching, so a ``"macos"`` spec doesn't match a hypothetical
    ``"macos_beta"`` spec.
  * the legacy trio (``linux_only`` / ``macos_only`` / ``windows_only``),
    matched as whole words in both decorator and ``pytestmark`` forms.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py macos [tests_root]

Prints one path per line (POSIX separators, repo-relative), sorted.
