"""Per-install update-channel records.

Channel storage — per install, never home-global::

    update:
      installs:
        a4f3b2c1d0e9f8a7:                      # install id (sha16 of the
          path: /home/u/.hermes/hermes-agent   #   canonical install root)
          channel: canary

One config.yaml serves many installs (host + docker gateway + desktop all
bind-mount one ``~/.hermes``), so a home-global ``update.channel`` key is
UNSAFE and does not exist: setting canary for a dev checkout must not
flip the desktop app's feed. The id is sha16 of the canonical
install-root PATH — the same key that names the ``installs/<sha16>/``
state folder (``boot_bootstrap._install_key``; a byte-identical helper is
inlined below until that module lands). Path-derived on purpose: an
electron-updater update replaces the artifact (new stamp bytes) at the
same path, and the channel opt-in must survive that.

* Written by ``hermes update --set-channel <x>`` from inside an install
  (it knows its own id — the user never types a sha).
* Shown by ``hermes update --install-id`` and the desktop About page.
* Channels are meaningful ONLY where the mechanism is ``self`` (which git
  ref: main / stable / canary→main) or ``electron-updater`` (which feed:
  latest.yml / canary.yml). ``external`` installs have no channel; the
  steward owns updates.

Pure-stdlib leaf module (plus hermes-internal imports done lazily): the
installers and boot paths read it before the full config machinery loads.
